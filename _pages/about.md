## The problem we are tackling
GreenFit AI is an application designed to guide customers in purchasing sustainable sportswear.

We began developing it after conducting a survey that revealed a significant insight: people of all ages consider sustainability a key aspect of the sports fashion industry. However, most respondents admitted they struggled to distinguish between sustainable and unsustainable sportswear.

We saw this as a critical problem in the fight against climate change - an issue we deeply care about. That inspired us to create GreenFit AI.

## Our core values

What values underpin this application? Not only a profound love for our planet but also a strong commitment to helping people make more informed choices, as well as a belief in the necessity of increasing access to open data. This is the reason why we carried out an extensive research, analyzing numerous academic papers, brand reports, and documents from international organizations.

Our goal was to gather as much information as possible about the sustainability policies of major sportswear companies. You can explore the results of this research simply using our app.

## Why GreenFit AI

GreenFit AI is an organization focused on building new tools to empower users in finding transparent, easy-to-interpret and actionable information about the sustainability of sports clothing and their brands. 

What we are building is a web application that is:

- Data-centered and data-obsessed: we scanned numerous scientific publications and independent reports and we built a curated database that serves as a background for our product evaluation

- AI-powered: we natively integrated Large Language Models in our application workflow. The user can then perform complex searches in their everyday language, and the LLMs will take care of optimizing them for product search purposes; when the results of the product search are back, the LLM will take care of evaluating them based also on the contextual information retrieved from our database

- Modern and dynamic: our user interface is based on a popular backend-to-frontend framework, Streamlit, and employes secure user authentication and management with a widely used database-management structure, Supabase

We are committed to open-source, data transparency, reliable sustainability and accessibility: we want everyone to be able to access information on the environmental impact of sports fashion in a fast, intuitive and trustworthy way.
